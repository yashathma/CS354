     * 1) The size of each heap block must be a multiple of 8
     * 2) heap blocks have blockHeaders that contain size and status bits
     * 3) free heap block contain a footer, but we can use the blockHeader 
     *.
     * All heap blocks have a blockHeader with size and status
     * Free heap blocks have a blockHeader as its footer with size only
     *
     * Status is stored using the two least significant bits.
     *   Bit0 => least significant bit, last bit
     *   Bit0 == 0 => free block
     *   Bit0 == 1 => allocated block
     *
     *   Bit1 => second last bit 
     *   Bit1 == 0 => previous block is free
     *   Bit1 == 1 => previous block is allocated
     * 
     * Start Heap: 
     *  The blockHeader for the first block of the heap is after skip 4 bytes.
     *  This ensures alignment requirements can be met.
     * 
     * End Mark: 
     *  The end of the available memory is indicated using a size_status of 1.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * 
     * 1. Allocated block of size 24 bytes:
     *    Allocated Block Header:
     *      If the previous block is free      p-bit=0 size_status would be 25
     *      If the previous block is allocated p-bit=1 size_status would be 27
     * 
     * 2. Free block of size 24 bytes:
     *    Free Block Header:
     *      If the previous block is free      p-bit=0 size_status would be 24
     *      If the previous block is allocated p-bit=1 size_status would be 26
     *    Free Block Footer:
     *      size_status should be 24

 * Function for allocating 'size' bytes of heap memory.
 * Argument size: requested size for the payload
 * Returns address of allocated block (payload) on success.
 * Returns NULL on failure.
 *
 * This function must:
 * - Check size - Return NULL if size < 1 
 * - Determine block size rounding up to a multiple of 8 
 *   and possibly adding padding as a result.
 *
 * - Use BEST-FIT PLACEMENT POLICY to chose a free block
 *
 * - If the BEST-FIT block that is found is exact size match
 *   - 1. Update all heap blocks as needed for any affected blocks
 *   - 2. Return the address of the allocated block payload
 *
 * - If the BEST-FIT block that is found is large enough to split 
 *   - 1. SPLIT the free block into two valid heap blocks:
 *         1. an allocated block
 *         2. a free block
 *         NOTE: both blocks must meet heap block requirements 
 *       - Update all heap block header(s) and footer(s) 
 *              as needed for any affected blocks.
 *   - 2. Return the address of the allocated block payload
 *
 *   Return if NULL unable to find and allocate block for required size
 *
 * Note: payload address that is returned is NOT the address of the
 *       block header.  It is the address of the start of the 
 *       available memory for the requesterr.
 *
 * Tips: Be careful with pointer arithmetic and scale factors.

/* 
 * Function for freeing up a previously allocated block.
 * Argument ptr: address of the block to be freed up.
 * Returns 0 on success.

 * This function should:
 * - Return -1 if ptr is NULL.
 * - Return -1 if ptr is not a multiple of 8.
 * - Return -1 if ptr is outside of the heap space.
 * - Return -1 if ptr block is already freed.
 * - Update header(s) and footer as needed.
 *
 * If free results in two or more adjacent free blocks,
 * they will be immediately coalesced into one larger free block.
 * so free blocks require a footer (blockHeader works) to store the size
 *
 * TIP: work on getting immediate coalescing to work after your code 
 *      can pass the tests in partA and partB of tests/ directory.
 *      Submit code that passes partA and partB to Canvas before continuing.
